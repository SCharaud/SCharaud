Hi, I’m @SCharaud
I've been tinkering spatial data for almost 15 years.
I'm interested in Python scripts or plugins for Qgis, SQL (postGIS), and data analyses with R. Everything that can simplify the access to spatial data for "newbies", or improve the way to answer to precise questions thru the jungle of spatial data.
